Dear NIA Team,

On [timestamp], I observed suspicious activity by [cheater] targeting a portal in the vicinity. The attack consisted of repeated bursts of XMPs delivered in an unnaturally fast and consistent sequence. The timing between each attack was almost identical, which suggests the use of automated tools or scripts rather than manual gameplay. This pattern deviates significantly from normal human behavior, where slight variations in timing and targeting are expected. Given the suspicious nature of these rapid, rhythmic attacks, I recommend further investigation to determine if cheating software is being employed.

Hello,

During gameplay on [timestamp], I witnessed [cheater] attacking a portal with an unusual pattern that appeared highly mechanical. The attack sequence involved fast, repeated bursts of fire with little to no variation in interval timing. This continuous, rapid-fire approach is inconsistent with typical player behavior, as it lacks the natural delays and irregularities one would expect during manual attacks. This repetitive and methodical sequence strongly indicates automated or spoofed activity, which undermines fair play in the game.

Dear NIA,

I would like to report a suspicious attack pattern observed at [timestamp]. The player identified as [cheater] engaged a portal with bursts of fire that were consistently timed and repeated at an unusually high speed. The sequence of attacks showed no irregular pauses or delays, suggesting that the behavior was controlled by automation. Human players generally show varied attack intervals and occasional targeting changes, neither of which were present here. Such evidence points towards the possibility of an unfair advantage through the use of cheating software.

Hi,

The bursts of XMP fire were extremely rapid and repeated with precise regularity, lacking the subtle variations characteristic of manual play.

Dear Support,

I am reporting suspicious activity from [cheater] detected on [timestamp]. The attack on a portal was conducted with unusually fast and repeated bursts of fire that followed a consistent timing pattern.

I urge the investigation team to consider this data in their review.

Hello NIA,

On [timestamp], I observed an abnormal attack pattern from [cheater] on a portal. The sequence consisted of multiple bursts delivered in a very short and consistent time frame, far exceeding typical human input speed.

Dear Team,

During my session at [timestamp], I noticed that [cheater] was attacking a portal with a pattern of repeated bursts that were unnaturally fast and consistent.

Hi NIA,

I would like to bring attention to the behavior of [cheater] on [timestamp], where the player launched a series of attacks on a portal with a suspiciously rapid and repetitive pattern.

Dear NIA Support,

I observed [cheater] attacking a portal on [timestamp] with an attack sequence that was highly suspicious. The firing pattern was characterized by repeated, rapid bursts of XMPs with uniform timing.
