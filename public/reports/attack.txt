Hey,

Noticed something odd with [cheater] today. On [timestamp], they hit a portal so fast, all resonators dropped in a synchronized manner.

Dear NIA Operations,

During my routine play on [timestamp], I monitored activity at the portal. The player [cheater] engaged in an attack pattern that involved hitting resonators in quick bursts, all occurring in less than 10 seconds, without moving between shots.

While this could be a coincidence, the timing and sequence were unusually consistent compared to typical manual gameplay.

[link]

Thank you,  
[codename]

Dear NIA,

I am submitting an observation from [timestamp] regarding player [cheater]'s activity at the portal. The portal suffered a rapid series of attacks with little variation in timing, and the XMPs appeared to be fired in a repetitive and systematic manner.

While I understand gameplay can vary, this behavior seemed worth flagging.

[link]

Hello NIA,

On [timestamp], I saw [cheater] attacking. The bursts occurred in rapid succession, each hit spaced equally, and the attacks circled the portal in a uniform clockwise fashion. This was unlike typical gameplay I’ve encountered.

I’m submitting this for your awareness.

Dear NIA,

I would like to report a suspicious attack pattern observed at [timestamp]. The player identified as [cheater] engaged a portal with bursts of fire that were consistently timed and repeated at an unusually high speed. The sequence of attacks showed no irregular pauses or delays, suggesting that the behavior was controlled by automation. Human players generally show varied attack intervals and occasional targeting changes, neither of which were present here. Such evidence points towards the possibility of an unfair advantage through the use of cheating software.

[link]

Kind regards,

Dear Team,

During my session at [timestamp], I noticed that [cheater] was attacking a portal with a pattern of repeated bursts that were unnaturally fast and consistent. The attacks were spaced with mechanical precision, suggesting the possibility of an automated attack method. Normal players tend to have irregular timing between their attacks due to varying reaction speeds and strategic choices, but this case showed none of those human characteristics. I recommend a thorough review to confirm potential cheating.

Thank you,

Dear NIA,

During my observation on [timestamp], I recorded suspicious attack behavior from [cheater] targeting a portal. The attack sequence involved a rapid series of bursts fired at precise, repetitive intervals, which strongly indicates the use of automated scripts rather than manual input. Such artificial attack patterns undermine the competitive integrity of the game, and I believe it merits further investigation.
