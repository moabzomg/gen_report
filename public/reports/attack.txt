Dear NIA Team,

On [timestamp], I observed suspicious activity by [cheater] targeting a portal in the vicinity. The attack consisted of repeated bursts of XMPs delivered in an unnaturally fast and consistent sequence. The timing between each attack was almost identical, which suggests the use of automated tools or scripts rather than manual gameplay. This pattern deviates significantly from normal human behavior, where slight variations in timing and targeting are expected. Given the suspicious nature of these rapid, rhythmic attacks, I recommend further investigation to determine if cheating software is being employed.

Dear NIA,

I would like to report a suspicious attack pattern observed at [timestamp]. The player identified as [cheater] engaged a portal with bursts of fire that were consistently timed and repeated at an unusually high speed. The sequence of attacks showed no irregular pauses or delays, suggesting that the behavior was controlled by automation. Human players generally show varied attack intervals and occasional targeting changes, neither of which were present here. Such evidence points towards the possibility of an unfair advantage through the use of cheating software.

Dear Support,

I am reporting suspicious activity from [cheater] detected on [timestamp]. The attack on a portal was conducted with unusually fast and repeated bursts of fire that followed a consistent timing pattern.
