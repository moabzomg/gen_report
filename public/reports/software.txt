There is strong evidence that Agent [cheater] is using third-party tools or unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage. Portal actions are executed with abnormal speed and consistency beyond human capability.
This compromises the integrity of the game. Please investigate the agent’s activity for potential violations.

Hi,
[cheater] always captures portals and then follows with another agent deploying instantly. Seems like a clear multi-account behavior.

Hello Niantic Team,

I’m reporting [cheater] who has shown suspiciously erratic GPS data on [timestamp]. The movements indicate the use of a third-party location spoofing tool.

To Niantic,

The data for [cheater] on [timestamp] shows sudden teleports and location jumps that violate game rules and indicate spoofing.

Hello,

I noticed [cheater] using GPS spoofing on [timestamp]. The location changes are unnatural and outside reasonable player behavior.

Niantic Team,

[cheater]’s position on [timestamp] moves erratically over large distances in seconds, pointing to use of a GPS spoofing application.

[cheater]’s in-game movements recorded on [timestamp] defy real-world travel limitations, indicating use of a third-party location faker.
