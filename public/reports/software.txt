There is strong evidence that Agent [cheater] is using third-party tools or unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage. Portal actions are executed with abnormal speed and consistency beyond human capability.
This compromises the integrity of the game. Please investigate the agent’s activity for potential violations.
