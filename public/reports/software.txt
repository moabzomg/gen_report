There is strong evidence that Agent [cheater] is using third-party tools or unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage. Portal actions are executed with abnormal speed and consistency beyond human capability.

This compromises the integrity of the game. Please investigate the agent’s activity for potential violations.

I’d like to report Agent [cheater] for repeated cheating via spoofing or other unauthorized methods. Their actions have disrupted multiple agent operations in our area, and this behavior has become a frequent issue.

There are signs that [cheater] is using third-party tools or scripts. Their reaction time and movement patterns are unusually consistent and faster than humanly possible.

Dear Niantic Enforcement Team,

We have detected consistent patterns of automated gameplay from the account associated with [cheater]. The actions recorded show highly repetitive, precise timing intervals and identical action sequences that are improbable for human players.

These findings strongly suggest the use of third-party bot software or scripting tools to automate game interactions, providing unfair advantages.

Hello Niantic,

The player [cheater] exhibits clear signs of gameplay automation. Detailed analysis of in-game activity reveals identical, repeated inputs at a speed and consistency beyond normal human capabilities.

Such behavior violates the Terms of Service and undermines the community’s integrity.
