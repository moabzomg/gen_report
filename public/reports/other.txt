During [timestamp], [cheater] drove past my home and took pictures of me playing. This is stalking.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] let an enemy destroy a portal, then rebuilt it with the same links minutes later. They did this several times.  
[link]
---
This isn't competition — it’s coordination. [cheater] met with another faction agent at [timestamp] and they swapped fields for badges.  
[link]
---
They are rotating between the same three portals. At [timestamp], [cheater] captured, then let another agent destroy, then repeated.  
[link]

Badge farming is happening here. [cheater] set up weak portals and let them be destroyed on purpose. We recorded this at [timestamp].

Logs at [timestamp] show perfect 10-minute cycles of build and destroy between the same two players. Definitely a farming loop.

At [timestamp], [cheater] was seen dropping capsules on the ground and walking away while another agent of the opposing faction came to collect them minutes later. This is a clear case of illicit item trading.  
[link]

This has become routine. At [timestamp], [cheater] parked, dropped multiple capsules near a key portal, and left. A few minutes later, a different faction agent picked them up without any interaction.  
[link]
---
I filmed [cheater] dropping a capsule on the ground and sending a message over an external chat group. Moments later (around [timestamp]), a low-level enemy agent picked up the items and vanished.  
[link]

It happened again at [timestamp]. [cheater] is using neutral portals to leave gear for the opposing team. This encourages coordinated item trading outside intended gameplay.

[link]
---
[cheater] and several unknown agents built a dense BAF at [timestamp] that blocks regional plans. Most accounts had no prior activity. Likely spoof-created.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used a farm of throwaway accounts to build up a portal cluster overnight. Each account deployed only once and disappeared. These accounts are all below L3 and have zero stats beyond that one event, indicating they were made solely to build shielding.  
[link]

[timestamp]
 [link]

---
[cheater] used multiple disposable accounts to deploy rare shields across portals, and those accounts have not been active since.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The agent repeatedly flipped a portal to block links despite having no strategic need. This occurred daily for over a week.  
[timestamp]  
[link]

Portals were being upgraded daily by different accounts with no XM gains or linking, suggesting gear sinks rather than gameplay.  
[timestamp]

To whom it may concern,

This is a formal report regarding potential account sharing between users. I observed that the account associated with [cheater] is accessed from multiple IP addresses simultaneously, indicating the likely use of multiple players or account rentals. This violates the game's terms and creates an unfair advantage.

Please investigate the following data:
