At [timestamp], [cheater] was observed repeatedly recharging portals and linking back and forth with another agent within 30 seconds intervals, suggesting multi-device usage or account sharing.

[link]

Please check linked account actions around this timestamp.
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] engaged in what looks like win trading. They let another agent destroy links, only to rebuild the same ones minutes later in identical order. This happened repeatedly.

[link]

This benefits both accounts unfairly and clearly violates fair play expectations.
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used the COMM to send harassing messages after I re-captured a portal. They implied stalking and real-life retaliation.  
[link]
---
[cheater] has been targeting agents personally. At [timestamp], they posted my real name and workplace in chat. This is unacceptable.  
[link]
---
I was followed physically by [cheater] after an in-game encounter on [timestamp]. They made verbal threats related to portal control.  
[link]
---
This player, [cheater], mocked me using my disability in COMM at [timestamp]. The screenshots are extremely offensive.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] threatened to damage my bike if I ever “touched their field again.”  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] sent messages mocking another agent’s race and appearance. This goes beyond competitive gameplay.  
[link]
---
They repeatedly post offensive memes in COMM tied to players in our area. Most recently at [timestamp].  
[link]
---
[cheater] has been falsely accusing other agents in public groups of cheating. At [timestamp], it escalated to doxxing.  
[link]
---
During [timestamp], [cheater] drove past my home and took pictures of me playing. This is stalking.  
[link]
---
They create fake social media accounts to target agents and spread misinformation. Last one was made at [timestamp].  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] let an enemy destroy a portal, then rebuilt it with the same links minutes later. They did this several times.  
[link]
---
We observed [cheater] and another agent flip-flopping a key anchor back and forth. They clearly aren’t enemies. This happened at [timestamp].  
[link]
---
This isn't competition — it’s coordination. [cheater] met with another faction agent at [timestamp] and they swapped fields for badges.  
[link]
---
There’s a repeating pattern where [cheater] gets portals destroyed by the same person, then rebuilds them. Again observed at [timestamp].  
[link]
---
They are rotating between the same three portals. At [timestamp], [cheater] captured, then let another agent destroy, then repeated.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] let their field collapse from a single portal and made zero attempts to stop it — instead congratulated the other team.  
[link]
---
Badge farming is happening here. [cheater] set up weak portals and let them be destroyed on purpose. We recorded this at [timestamp].  
[link]
---
It’s suspicious that two agents from opposite factions meet every Sunday morning. At [timestamp], they cleared each other’s anchors again.  
[link]
---
Logs at [timestamp] show perfect 10-minute cycles of build and destroy between the same two players. Definitely a farming loop.  
[link]
---
[cheater] dropped keys for the enemy team to make links and then re-linked afterward. Observed at [timestamp].  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] was seen dropping capsules on the ground and walking away while another agent of the opposing faction came to collect them minutes later. This is a clear case of illicit item trading.  
[link]
---
Capsule trading was observed again at [timestamp]. [cheater] left behind gear on a portal, and not long after, a known enemy agent arrived and picked it up. No actions were taken between them.  
[link]
---
This has become routine. At [timestamp], [cheater] parked, dropped multiple capsules near a key portal, and left. A few minutes later, a different faction agent picked them up without any interaction.  
[link]
---
During [timestamp], [cheater] dropped gear and left the area. Seconds later, an account with no activity history showed up and collected the items. The trade was clearly prearranged.  
[link]
---
I filmed [cheater] dropping a capsule on the ground and sending a message over an external chat group. Moments later (around [timestamp]), a low-level enemy agent picked up the items and vanished.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] made a series of short visits to portals without taking any in-game actions. The only thing they did was leave capsules. Another agent arrived within 10 minutes.  
[link]
---
It happened again at [timestamp]. [cheater] is using neutral portals to leave gear for the opposing team. This encourages coordinated item trading outside intended gameplay.  
[link]
---
Suspicious behavior was noted at [timestamp]. [cheater] left a capsule at a remote portal, and it was retrieved by someone from another faction who has no known links to that area.  
[link]
---
This is item laundering, essentially. [cheater] dropped gear at [timestamp], including multiple L8 resonators and XMPs, and within minutes they disappeared. We tracked the recipient.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] coordinated a meet-up where capsules were left at a park bench without logging any actions. It was a trade, not gameplay.

[link]
---

[link]
---
[cheater] and several unknown agents built a dense BAF at [timestamp] that blocks regional plans. Most accounts had no prior activity. Likely spoof-created.  
[link]
---
[cheater] used six low-level burner accounts in one hour at [timestamp] to destroy a farm and block re-capture. This was coordinated abuse.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used a farm of throwaway accounts to build up a portal cluster overnight. Each account deployed only once and disappeared. These accounts are all below L3 and have zero stats beyond that one event, indicating they were made solely to build shielding.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] arranged a field block operation by repeatedly flipping portals and installing link-amp mods with junk keys. The goal was to prevent BAF operations, not for gameplay. This was witnessed and recorded as it happened.  
[link]
---
During [timestamp], [cheater] left misleading COMM messages under a different faction’s color to impersonate another player and provoke a response. Several agents received insults and baiting remarks from an account that hadn’t been active in months.  
[link]
---
A suspicious level of key ownership was discovered at [timestamp]. [cheater] owns hundreds of keys to portals they’ve never visited, including several overseas anchors. Given the lack of travel history, this strongly suggests key laundering or item trading.  
[link]
---
[cheater] captured portals in a restricted location with no public access, such as a rooftop or fenced facility, without being seen by nearby agents.  
[timestamp] 
[link]

[timestamp]
 [link]  
---
Linking operations between distant portals were executed with high-speed precision, consistent timing, and no GPS drift—unusual for regular mobile use.  
[link]  
---
[cheater] used over 100 XMPs in quick succession with uniform intervals. The button press rhythm appears too consistent for manual interaction.

Actions such as deploy–mod–link–glyph were repeated exactly the same way dozens of times within short periods, suggesting macro-like behavior.  
[link]

[timestamp]

Portal modifications and linking behavior occurred at the exact same time every day, with no location variation—suggesting scheduled or automated input.  
[timestamp]
 [link]  
---
[cheater] performed hundreds of consecutive actions without any system misclicks, delays, or fatigue indicators, which is uncommon in human play.

Hello Niantic team,

I am writing to report suspicious activity involving the player [cheater]. On [timestamp], I noticed several unusual actions that strongly suggest the use of third-party software. Their in-game behavior displayed impossible reaction times and repeated patterns that are consistent with automation. This has been ongoing for several days, and it significantly disrupts fair play.

Please review the evidence provided here:
