Hello,
I’d like to report potential multi-accounting by Agent [cheater]. Several accounts are acting in lockstep with them, repeatedly assisting in portal captures, resonator deployment, and field creation.
The coordinated actions strongly suggest the same person is managing multiple accounts, which is against the rules.

Thank you,

Hi,

I’m reporting a player using multiple accounts. On [timestamp], [cheater] and another level 5 account acted in perfect coordination within seconds, flipping, recharging, and deploying simultaneously.

[link]

The behavior is too synchronized to be legitimate. Likely a win-trading or multi-account setup.
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] and a low-level agent appeared at the same portal. One deployed resonators, the other flipped them repeatedly. It's clearly a multi-account situation.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], two agents were used in tandem to hold a farm — both sharing the same movement pattern. Device switching logs should confirm this.  
[link]
---
Two agents using identical movement routes and patterns appeared at [timestamp]. Only one player was physically present.  
[link]
---
[cheater] was seen flipping their own portal using another agent's account at [timestamp], then linking back in a loop. Definitely multi-accounting.  
[link]
---
Niantic, during [timestamp], [cheater] coordinated with an account that has no profile, no history, and only appears when this player is around.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] was seen dropping capsules on the ground and walking away while another agent of the opposing faction came to collect them minutes later. This is a clear case of illicit item trading.  
[link]
---
This has become routine. At [timestamp], [cheater] parked, dropped multiple capsules near a key portal, and left. A few minutes later, a different faction agent picked them up without any interaction.  
[link]
---
I filmed [cheater] dropping a capsule on the ground and sending a message over an external chat group. Moments later (around [timestamp]), a low-level enemy agent picked up the items and vanished.  
[link]
---
It happened again at [timestamp]. [cheater] is using neutral portals to leave gear for the opposing team. This encourages coordinated item trading outside intended gameplay.  
[link]
---
This is item laundering, essentially. [cheater] dropped gear at [timestamp], including multiple L8 resonators and XMPs, and within minutes they disappeared. We tracked the recipient.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used two accounts to attack and recharge a portal in sequence, with no time gap in between. Both accounts showed identical movement logs.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] deployed one account’s resonators, then immediately upgraded them using a second account, alternating actions perfectly.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] was seen switching between two phones, using one for attacking and the other for capturing, within visible range of our team.  
[link]
---
[cheater] coordinated with a Level 1 account that only appears when they play. At [timestamp], both were used to capture and build.  
[link]
---
The second account activated mods and keys at [timestamp] in a way that allowed [cheater]'s main account to easily link. This is not coincidence.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used account A to neutralize a portal and account B to immediately capture and fully deploy it. Both phones were seen in the same hand, and the player alternated between them flawlessly, confirming a multi-account strategy to control portal ownership solo.  
[link]
---
During [timestamp], [cheater] orchestrated a portal attack using three accounts—two to attack and one to shield and recharge in real time. We witnessed the person swipe between three phones mounted on a dash holder in their car.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] used a L2 dummy account to place soft mods on portals ahead of time, creating easy anchors for their main account. This kind of portal setup is never useful for strategic play unless someone is setting up their own playground.  
[link]
---
Account A and Account B took turns capturing and recharging the same portal, with alternating mod deployment within seconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Both accounts shared the same movement path over multiple days, always appearing together at capture events, with one always benefiting the other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During an operation, three accounts acted in perfect sequence to control and protect a portal. They were operated from the same vehicle.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
A known low-level account was used to hold large amounts of gear and pass them to [cheater] repeatedly across various cities.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
his dummy account would deploy soft mods and leave the portal unlinked, only for [cheater] to link and complete the setup moments later.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] used one account to repeatedly deploy portals and another to link and upgrade. Both actions occurred from the same bench within minutes.  
[link]
---
An L8 account was seen recharging and guarding a portal for an L16 account that would later use it for key farming. No attempt to hide association.  
[link]
---
A series of throwaway accounts were used to deploy common mods and protect field lanes. These accounts never returned after initial actions.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], two accounts submitted missions and portals at the same time with exact naming conventions. One was clearly meant to support the other.  
[link]
---
An L1 account was sacrificed to clear defensive mods on a portal, making way for [cheater] to recapture and mod it cleanly.  
[link]
---
An agent dropped gear in a remote spot, immediately picked up by another account under the same operator. The gear transfer happened in under 5 seconds.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], both accounts deployed identical mods at the same portals and coordinated attacks, clearly controlled by the same person.  
[link]
---
Agent logs show two accounts used to spoof “cross-faction” battles to farm AP quickly, all occurring at dead times with no actual resistance.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During key drop operations, the player used a dummy account to mule hundreds of keys across regions. No gear was used for other actions.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The player maintains several low-level accounts purely to deploy shields before major ops, allowing main account to benefit from bonus gear.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
One agent systematically destroys portals while another follows up within 15 seconds to deploy and link, always from the same IP and device type.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Over the course of two hours, the player built dozens of identical fields, with one account placing keys and another linking them.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The agent dropped capsules loaded with gear at [timestamp], which were instantly picked up by another nearby account. Witnesses confirmed solo activity.  
[link]
---
A Level 3 account is constantly recharging a set of portals for the main agent, even when the main account is logged off.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two known aliases used by the same person coordinated portal drops at precise times to simulate cross-faction play. Only one person was observed.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two accounts held all anchor portals in the area. Surveillance by teammates confirms both phones were used by one person at the same bench.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
All captured portals were immediately defended by a Level 3 recharger account located in the same physical location as [cheater].  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[Cheater] staged multiple attacks on home portals at odd hours using different accounts. Only one person was seen outside on security camera.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Repeated mod flipping between two usernames every 5 minutes was done in the same park bench. Witnesses confirm only one person present.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[Cheater] used one account to flip a portal and the other to recapture it with a full deploy. All actions done within a 30-second window.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two accounts consistently flip mods on the same portals in rotation, with physical evidence that the accounts are operated by one person.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple accounts were used to reinforce each other’s portals repeatedly during late night hours when no other players were active.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
An agent operated two accounts simultaneously, one controlling links while the other placed resonators and mods on the same portal.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two accounts farmed portal keys in the same location repeatedly, always arriving and leaving together.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Agent used one account to field build and a second to keep fields alive by deploying resonators and mods.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
A player logged into two accounts alternately within minutes to field control and link creation on the same portals.  
[timestamp]  
[link]

Two cheaters sharing the same IP repeatedly flipped the same portal, indicating possible account sharing.

A capsule containing rare gear was dropped by a shell account and immediately picked up by [cheater], with no fielding or hacking by the original owner.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Portals across a 5km area were captured within three minutes by [cheater], supported by alt accounts deploying and linking in sync. GPS offset logs suggest multi-phone usage.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Repetitive gear funneling behavior observed where low-level accounts drop items in secluded areas for [cheater] to collect. None of the accounts show normal progression.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Layered fields were built using resonators deployed by ghost accounts that only appear once in the portal history — all connected to [cheater]’s activity pattern.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
An account with zero field activity was used to flip blockers just ahead of [cheater]’s fielding burst. This enabled multi-layered links that otherwise weren’t possible.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple capsules tagged to [cheater] passed through 3 other accounts before being used in field construction. None of the transfer agents showed any deploy or hack activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]

Multiple accounts under [cheater]’s control appear to work in perfect sync to maintain field integrity and power, with no signs of genuine individual activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
High-speed deployment of resonators from several accounts occurred during a narrow time window at [timestamp], strongly suggesting multi-device or multi-account manipulation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During a critical op, recharge bursts from three different accounts coordinated to preserve [cheater]’s fields from enemy decay, all within milliseconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] used two distinct devices to simultaneously hack and deploy mods on neighboring portals, as indicated by timestamp logs and rapid action sequences.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Three separate accounts deployed and recharged portals within a 30-second window at [timestamp], reflecting impossible timing for a single user.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater]’s backup accounts remain inactive except for brief periods when supporting field building and recharging during major ops.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] repeatedly drops capsules in isolated locations only to have alt accounts pick them up instantly, circumventing normal gameplay rules.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Helper accounts connected to [cheater] show no solo activity but rapidly perform key actions in sync with the main account during major events.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the coordinated event at [timestamp], multiple accounts linked to [cheater] deployed resonators and mods on adjacent portals almost simultaneously, indicating multi-device operation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], three different accounts owned by [cheater] participated in portal recharging within seconds, a speed impossible for a single player using one device.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Evidence at [timestamp] confirms that multiple IDs under [cheater]’s control were logged hacking the same portal within milliseconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the op at [timestamp], [cheater] leveraged multiple accounts to sustain portal shields and links against enemy attacks, as recharge logs indicate near-simultaneous activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Recharge sequences from multiple IDs linked to [cheater] overlap almost perfectly during field defense, demonstrating multi-account coordination.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the time frame around [timestamp], several accounts logged actions on the same portal in near perfect succession, an indicator of device switching or multi-device use.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Accounts associated with [cheater] consistently appear only to recharge and deploy mods, never engaging in normal hacking or fielding activities, indicating helper roles.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The deployment of high-value mods by multiple accounts linked to [cheater] occurred at [timestamp] within seconds, too fast for sequential play by a single user.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Recharge and deploy logs show multiple accounts active simultaneously within a 60-second window, supporting fields controlled by [cheater].  
[timestamp]

[cheater]’s capsule inventories are replenished by transfers from several alt accounts, as seen at [timestamp], enabling sustained field creation without normal farming.  
[timestamp]  
[link]

At [timestamp], multiple accounts connected to [cheater] simultaneously recharged and deployed mods on the same set of portals, a clear indication of multi-account coordination.  
[link]
---
Records from [timestamp] reveal capsule transfers between [cheater]’s accounts, facilitating the movement of high-level items without legitimate gameplay.  
[link]
---
[cheater] used several accounts concurrently at [timestamp] to bypass normal cooldowns and extend portal control beyond usual limits.  
[link]
---
Simultaneous hacking and mod deployment from accounts associated with [cheater] at [timestamp] indicate coordinated multi-account gameplay.  
[link]
---
Data from [timestamp] confirms [cheater]’s use of multiple accounts exclusively for strategic field maintenance, with little other gameplay involvement.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], multiple accounts registered under [cheater] were found simultaneously capturing and linking nearby portals, a clear multi-account strategy.  
[link]
---
The logs from [timestamp] indicate capsule exchanges between several accounts linked to [cheater], suggesting item trading through multi-accounting.  
[link]
---
[cheater]’s multiple accounts all performed portal hacks at [timestamp] within seconds of each other, an unlikely scenario without simultaneous device operation.  
[link]

Niantic,

Blatant cheating happening right in front of me. [cheater] did a fast drop-and-run at [timestamp]. Didn’t even pretend to play. Then, lo and behold, another agent scoops up everything. Wake up.

Why are item traders still playing freely? [cheater] has been doing this over and over. On [timestamp], they dumped several capsules and disappeared. A second player picked them up with surgical timing. This is coordinated cheating.

Niantic Enforcement,

At [timestamp], [cheater] was observed capturing multiple portals in a restricted area with no physical access. This behavior strongly suggests the use of multiple accounts or devices.

Please investigate [cheater] for suspicious activity noted on [timestamp]. The player linked portals across vast distances in a short time, indicating potential multi-account usage.

This is a formal report regarding [cheater]'s actions on [timestamp]. The player captured and linked portals in a suspicious pattern.

Sincerely,
[codename]

The community has noticed [cheater] consistently capturing portals in areas they cannot physically access. This occurred again on [timestamp].

Despite previous reports, [cheater] continues to operate multiple accounts. At [timestamp], they deployed resonators in a pattern consistent with account sharing.

Once again, [cheater] has been seen deploying resonators in remote locations at [timestamp]. This pattern has been reported before with no action taken.
[timestamp]
[link]

Frustrated,
[codename]
---
The pattern is clear: [cheater] uses one account to weaken portals and another to capture. Please take action.
[timestamp]
[link]

Multiple agents have witnessed [cheater] switching between accounts during gameplay. This undermines the integrity of Ingress.
[timestamp]
[link]

This is a formal report regarding [cheater]. The player appears to be using multiple accounts to control portal fields unfairly.
[timestamp]
[link]

Observed [cheater] deploying resonators with two devices in hand. This is a clear violation of fair play.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Another day, another incident involving [cheater]. The same pattern: one account clears, another links, all within seconds. This is not solo play.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Frustrated to report [cheater] again. Despite previous reports, the multi-account behavior continues. Simultaneous portal captures from different devices.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Please investigate [cheater] for suspected multi-account usage. Multiple devices were seen being used simultaneously to deploy resonators across several portals.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
It’s become increasingly obvious that [cheater] is operating multiple accounts. The pattern of portal captures and immediate linking from nearby accounts is too consistent to ignore.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Despite repeated reports, [cheater] continues to use multiple accounts. This behavior is affecting local gameplay balance.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
The local community has raised concerns about [cheater] using shared accounts. The timing and coordination of actions are beyond coincidence.
[timestamp]
[link]

Another incident involving [cheater] today. Multiple accounts were clearly used to deploy resonators and block links. This undermines fair gameplay.
[timestamp]
[link]

Please review the activity logs for [cheater]. The timing and coordination of actions suggest multi-account usage.
[timestamp]

We’ve documented [cheater] switching between devices and accounts during gameplay. This violates the spirit of Ingress.
[timestamp]
[link]
[codename]
---
This is the third time this week [cheater] has used multiple accounts to take down and rebuild portals. It’s coordinated and unfair.
[timestamp]
[link]
[codename]
---
We’ve seen [cheater] capturing and linking portals in a way that clearly involves more than one account. This is unfair and demoralizing.
[timestamp]
[link]
[codename]
---
It's becoming a pattern—[cheater] is always present at multiple portals simultaneously. This is not possible without account sharing or multi-device use.
[timestamp]
[link]
Sincerely,
[codename]
---
Frustrated to report [cheater] again. Despite previous reports, the same multi-account behavior continues. This is affecting our local community.
[timestamp]
[link]
[codename]
---
The community is losing faith in fair play. [cheater] is using multiple accounts to dominate key areas. Please take action.
[timestamp]
[link]

Please investigate [cheater] for suspected multi-account activity. The same player appears to be coordinating actions from different accounts within seconds.
