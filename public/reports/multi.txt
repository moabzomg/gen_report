Agent [cheater] is suspected of operating multiple accounts simultaneously. The accounts are frequently seen acting in coordination in a manner that gives [cheater] an unfair advantage during operations.

This violates the Ingress Terms of Service. I kindly request a review of the activity logs.

Hello,

I’d like to report potential multi-accounting by Agent [cheater]. Several accounts are acting in lockstep with them, repeatedly assisting in portal captures, resonator deployment, and field creation.

The coordinated actions strongly suggest the same person is managing multiple accounts, which is against the rules.

Hi,

I noticed unusual activity with [cheater]—their play style changes dramatically within short timeframes. This suggests that the account is being shared between multiple individuals.
