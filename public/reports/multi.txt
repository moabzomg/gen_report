Hello,
I’d like to report potential multi-accounting by Agent [cheater]. Several accounts are acting in lockstep with them, repeatedly assisting in portal captures, resonator deployment, and field creation.
The coordinated actions strongly suggest the same person is managing multiple accounts, which is against the rules.
