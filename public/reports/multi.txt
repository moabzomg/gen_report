Hello,
I’d like to report potential multi-accounting by Agent [cheater]. Several accounts are acting in lockstep with them, repeatedly assisting in portal captures, resonator deployment, and field creation.
The coordinated actions strongly suggest the same person is managing multiple accounts, which is against the rules.

Thank you,

Hi,

I’m reporting a player using multiple accounts. On [timestamp], [cheater] and another level 5 account acted in perfect coordination within seconds, flipping, recharging, and deploying simultaneously.

[link]

The behavior is too synchronized to be legitimate. Likely a win-trading or multi-account setup.
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] and a low-level agent appeared at the same portal. One deployed resonators, the other flipped them repeatedly. It's clearly a multi-account situation.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], two agents were used in tandem to hold a farm — both sharing the same movement pattern. Device switching logs should confirm this.  
[link]
---
Two agents using identical movement routes and patterns appeared at [timestamp]. Only one player was physically present.  
[link]
---
[cheater] was seen flipping their own portal using another agent's account at [timestamp], then linking back in a loop. Definitely multi-accounting.  
[link]
---
Niantic, during [timestamp], [cheater] coordinated with an account that has no profile, no history, and only appears when this player is around.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] was seen dropping capsules on the ground and walking away while another agent of the opposing faction came to collect them minutes later. This is a clear case of illicit item trading.  
[link]
---
This has become routine. At [timestamp], [cheater] parked, dropped multiple capsules near a key portal, and left. A few minutes later, a different faction agent picked them up without any interaction.  
[link]
---
I filmed [cheater] dropping a capsule on the ground and sending a message over an external chat group. Moments later (around [timestamp]), a low-level enemy agent picked up the items and vanished.  
[link]
---
It happened again at [timestamp]. [cheater] is using neutral portals to leave gear for the opposing team. This encourages coordinated item trading outside intended gameplay.  
[link]
---
This is item laundering, essentially. [cheater] dropped gear at [timestamp], including multiple L8 resonators and XMPs, and within minutes they disappeared. We tracked the recipient.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used two accounts to attack and recharge a portal in sequence, with no time gap in between. Both accounts showed identical movement logs.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] deployed one account’s resonators, then immediately upgraded them using a second account, alternating actions perfectly.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] was seen switching between two phones, using one for attacking and the other for capturing, within visible range of our team.  
[link]
---
[cheater] coordinated with a Level 1 account that only appears when they play. At [timestamp], both were used to capture and build.  
[link]
---
The second account activated mods and keys at [timestamp] in a way that allowed [cheater]'s main account to easily link. This is not coincidence.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used account A to neutralize a portal and account B to immediately capture and fully deploy it. Both phones were seen in the same hand, and the player alternated between them flawlessly, confirming a multi-account strategy to control portal ownership solo.  
[link]
---
During [timestamp], [cheater] orchestrated a portal attack using three accounts—two to attack and one to shield and recharge in real time. We witnessed the person swipe between three phones mounted on a dash holder in their car.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] used a L2 dummy account to place soft mods on portals ahead of time, creating easy anchors for their main account. This kind of portal setup is never useful for strategic play unless someone is setting up their own playground.  
[link]
---
Account A and Account B took turns capturing and recharging the same portal, with alternating mod deployment within seconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Both accounts shared the same movement path over multiple days, always appearing together at capture events, with one always benefiting the other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During an operation, three accounts acted in perfect sequence to control and protect a portal. They were operated from the same vehicle.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
A known low-level account was used to hold large amounts of gear and pass them to [cheater] repeatedly across various cities.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
his dummy account would deploy soft mods and leave the portal unlinked, only for [cheater] to link and complete the setup moments later.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] used one account to repeatedly deploy portals and another to link and upgrade. Both actions occurred from the same bench within minutes.  
[link]
---
An L8 account was seen recharging and guarding a portal for an L16 account that would later use it for key farming. No attempt to hide association.  
[link]
---
A series of throwaway accounts were used to deploy common mods and protect field lanes. These accounts never returned after initial actions.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], two accounts submitted missions and portals at the same time with exact naming conventions. One was clearly meant to support the other.  
[link]
---
An L1 account was sacrificed to clear defensive mods on a portal, making way for [cheater] to recapture and mod it cleanly.  
[link]
---
An agent dropped gear in a remote spot, immediately picked up by another account under the same operator. The gear transfer happened in under 5 seconds.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], both accounts deployed identical mods at the same portals and coordinated attacks, clearly controlled by the same person.  
[link]
---
Agent logs show two accounts used to spoof “cross-faction” battles to farm AP quickly, all occurring at dead times with no actual resistance.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During key drop operations, the player used a dummy account to mule hundreds of keys across regions. No gear was used for other actions.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The player maintains several low-level accounts purely to deploy shields before major ops, allowing main account to benefit from bonus gear.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
One agent systematically destroys portals while another follows up within 15 seconds to deploy and link, always from the same IP and device type.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Over the course of two hours, the player built dozens of identical fields, with one account placing keys and another linking them.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The agent dropped capsules loaded with gear at [timestamp], which were instantly picked up by another nearby account. Witnesses confirmed solo activity.  
[link]
---
A Level 3 account is constantly recharging a set of portals for the main agent, even when the main account is logged off.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two known aliases used by the same person coordinated portal drops at precise times to simulate cross-faction play. Only one person was observed.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two accounts held all anchor portals in the area. Surveillance by teammates confirms both phones were used by one person at the same bench.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
All captured portals were immediately defended by a Level 3 recharger account located in the same physical location as [cheater].  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[Cheater] staged multiple attacks on home portals at odd hours using different accounts. Only one person was seen outside on security camera.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Repeated mod flipping between two usernames every 5 minutes was done in the same park bench. Witnesses confirm only one person present.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[Cheater] used one account to flip a portal and the other to recapture it with a full deploy. All actions done within a 30-second window.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two accounts consistently flip mods on the same portals in rotation, with physical evidence that the accounts are operated by one person.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple accounts were used to reinforce each other’s portals repeatedly during late night hours when no other players were active.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
An agent operated two accounts simultaneously, one controlling links while the other placed resonators and mods on the same portal.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Two accounts farmed portal keys in the same location repeatedly, always arriving and leaving together.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Agent used one account to field build and a second to keep fields alive by deploying resonators and mods.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
A player logged into two accounts alternately within minutes to field control and link creation on the same portals.  
[timestamp]  
[link]

Two cheaters sharing the same IP repeatedly flipped the same portal, indicating possible account sharing.

A capsule containing rare gear was dropped by a shell account and immediately picked up by [cheater], with no fielding or hacking by the original owner.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Portals across a 5km area were captured within three minutes by [cheater], supported by alt accounts deploying and linking in sync. GPS offset logs suggest multi-phone usage.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Repetitive gear funneling behavior observed where low-level accounts drop items in secluded areas for [cheater] to collect. None of the accounts show normal progression.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Layered fields were built using resonators deployed by ghost accounts that only appear once in the portal history — all connected to [cheater]’s activity pattern.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
An account with zero field activity was used to flip blockers just ahead of [cheater]’s fielding burst. This enabled multi-layered links that otherwise weren’t possible.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple capsules tagged to [cheater] passed through 3 other accounts before being used in field construction. None of the transfer agents showed any deploy or hack activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]

Multiple accounts under [cheater]’s control appear to work in perfect sync to maintain field integrity and power, with no signs of genuine individual activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
High-speed deployment of resonators from several accounts occurred during a narrow time window at [timestamp], strongly suggesting multi-device or multi-account manipulation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During a critical op, recharge bursts from three different accounts coordinated to preserve [cheater]’s fields from enemy decay, all within milliseconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] used two distinct devices to simultaneously hack and deploy mods on neighboring portals, as indicated by timestamp logs and rapid action sequences.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Three separate accounts deployed and recharged portals within a 30-second window at [timestamp], reflecting impossible timing for a single user.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater]’s backup accounts remain inactive except for brief periods when supporting field building and recharging during major ops.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] repeatedly drops capsules in isolated locations only to have alt accounts pick them up instantly, circumventing normal gameplay rules.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Helper accounts connected to [cheater] show no solo activity but rapidly perform key actions in sync with the main account during major events.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the coordinated event at [timestamp], multiple accounts linked to [cheater] deployed resonators and mods on adjacent portals almost simultaneously, indicating multi-device operation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], three different accounts owned by [cheater] participated in portal recharging within seconds, a speed impossible for a single player using one device.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Evidence at [timestamp] confirms that multiple IDs under [cheater]’s control were logged hacking the same portal within milliseconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the op at [timestamp], [cheater] leveraged multiple accounts to sustain portal shields and links against enemy attacks, as recharge logs indicate near-simultaneous activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Recharge sequences from multiple IDs linked to [cheater] overlap almost perfectly during field defense, demonstrating multi-account coordination.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the time frame around [timestamp], several accounts logged actions on the same portal in near perfect succession, an indicator of device switching or multi-device use.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Accounts associated with [cheater] consistently appear only to recharge and deploy mods, never engaging in normal hacking or fielding activities, indicating helper roles.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The deployment of high-value mods by multiple accounts linked to [cheater] occurred at [timestamp] within seconds, too fast for sequential play by a single user.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Recharge and deploy logs show multiple accounts active simultaneously within a 60-second window, supporting fields controlled by [cheater].  
[timestamp]

[cheater]’s capsule inventories are replenished by transfers from several alt accounts, as seen at [timestamp], enabling sustained field creation without normal farming.  
[timestamp]  
[link]

At [timestamp], multiple accounts connected to [cheater] simultaneously recharged and deployed mods on the same set of portals, a clear indication of multi-account coordination.  
[link]
---
Records from [timestamp] reveal capsule transfers between [cheater]’s accounts, facilitating the movement of high-level items without legitimate gameplay.  
[link]
---
[cheater] used several accounts concurrently at [timestamp] to bypass normal cooldowns and extend portal control beyond usual limits.  
[link]
---
Simultaneous hacking and mod deployment from accounts associated with [cheater] at [timestamp] indicate coordinated multi-account gameplay.  
[link]
---
Data from [timestamp] confirms [cheater]’s use of multiple accounts exclusively for strategic field maintenance, with little other gameplay involvement.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], multiple accounts registered under [cheater] were found simultaneously capturing and linking nearby portals, a clear multi-account strategy.  
[link]
---
The logs from [timestamp] indicate capsule exchanges between several accounts linked to [cheater], suggesting item trading through multi-accounting.  
[link]
---
[cheater]’s multiple accounts all performed portal hacks at [timestamp] within seconds of each other, an unlikely scenario without simultaneous device operation.  
[link]

Niantic,

Blatant cheating happening right in front of me. [cheater] did a fast drop-and-run at [timestamp]. Didn’t even pretend to play. Then, lo and behold, another agent scoops up everything. Wake up.

Why are item traders still playing freely? [cheater] has been doing this over and over. On [timestamp], they dumped several capsules and disappeared. A second player picked them up with surgical timing. This is coordinated cheating.

Niantic Enforcement,

[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used two accounts to drain an enemy portal by firing from both ends. I observed this live.

Two accounts (one L16 and one L4) were seen on-site. The L4 dropped gear, and the L16 deployed and linked immediately after. Observed on [timestamp].  
[link]
---
[cheater] used one account to repeatedly deploy portals and another to link and upgrade. Both actions occurred from the same bench within minutes.  
[link]
---
During [timestamp], a known alt account captured and filled all slots. Minutes later, the main account flipped it and made links without resistance.  
[link]
---
An L8 account was seen recharging and guarding a portal for an L16 account that would later use it for key farming. No attempt to hide association.  
[link]
---
Main and alt accounts have matching play schedules, share the same GPS traces, and alternate between capture and support roles.  
[link]

It has come to my attention that [cheater] was involved in suspicious item transferring and capsule drops between accounts around [timestamp]. This coordinated activity is clearly an abuse of game mechanics and undermines fair play.

[link]

Kind regards,  
[codename]
---
Multiple accounts linked to [cheater] have been seen exchanging items and conducting capsule drops at [timestamp]. This exploitation disrupts the in-game economy and compromises gameplay integrity.

[link]

Regards,  
[codename]
---
At [timestamp], evidence surfaced that [cheater] was trading rare items between their accounts, often through rapid capsule drops. This coordinated effort is unfair to other players striving legitimately.

[link]

Best wishes,  
[codename]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] was detected transferring inventory items between accounts, frequently using capsules to facilitate quick drops. This pattern suggests intentional manipulation of game resources.

[link]

Kind regards,  
[codename]
---
Evidence at [timestamp] shows [cheater] engaging in synchronized capsule drops and item swapping across multiple accounts. This practice contravenes game rules designed to prevent resource hoarding.

[link]

Thanks,  
[codename]
---

Field and deploy activity consistently show [cheater] operating with multiple accounts. Item drops at [timestamp] were followed by immediate pickups from another profile with no AP gains, suggesting gear transfers.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple gear capsule exchanges took place within seconds between [cheater] and a known inactive account. This occurred during an ongoing op, aiding rapid portal control.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Alt accounts supporting [cheater] appear only during ops to deploy resonators or mods. These profiles exhibit no independent activity, existing solely to assist.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] created layered fields using synchronized links and mod deploys from two devices, as shown by simultaneous actions from separate accounts at [timestamp].  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Ghost accounts recharge [cheater]’s portals within milliseconds of enemy attacks. These support IDs never interact with other portals, confirming linked operation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
A capsule containing rare gear was dropped by a shell account and immediately picked up by [cheater], with no fielding or hacking by the original owner.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Same-portal mod deploys from multiple IDs registered at [timestamp], making it impossible for a solo agent to act that quickly. Patterns align with multi-device play by [cheater].  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Portals across a 5km area were captured within three minutes by [cheater], supported by alt accounts deploying and linking in sync. GPS offset logs suggest multi-phone usage.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Deploy logs show [cheater] and three backup IDs working in unison to fully mod and link key portals in under 90 seconds. These support accounts show no AP or badge progression.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Repetitive gear funneling behavior observed where low-level accounts drop items in secluded areas for [cheater] to collect. None of the accounts show normal progression.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Recharge events occurred across multiple portals at the exact [timestamp], using accounts linked to [cheater]’s main play zone. Only [cheater] benefited from the action.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Layered fields were built using resonators deployed by ghost accounts that only appear once in the portal history — all connected to [cheater]’s activity pattern.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Despite repeated enemy takedowns, portals owned by [cheater] were re-shielded instantly by helper profiles. Mod stacks mirror each other across all accounts.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
An account with zero field activity was used to flip blockers just ahead of [cheater]’s fielding burst. This enabled multi-layered links that otherwise weren’t possible.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
A series of eight portals were captured and linked within 70 seconds by [cheater] and their supporting IDs. No other agents were present during this sequence.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple capsules tagged to [cheater] passed through 3 other accounts before being used in field construction. None of the transfer agents showed any deploy or hack activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
The recharge trail indicates energy bursts coming from dormant accounts to support only [cheater]’s operations. These accounts have no visible presence outside those windows.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Same login pattern observed across [cheater]’s suspected accounts, all active within 10 seconds of each other and performing complementary tasks.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Helper ID deployed a single resonator after [cheater] destroyed the portal, then immediately went offline — pattern repeated six times during the same op.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] fields using VR gear consistently sourced from the same alt account. Item ID logs show direct inventory handoffs through capsules with zero AP exchange.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Account switching behavior is confirmed through identical mod deploy times and logins from shared IPs. These align with fielding bursts attributed to [cheater].  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the operation at [timestamp], multiple portals were simultaneously recharged by various accounts linked to [cheater], suggesting use of multi-device play.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Observations reveal that [cheater] coordinates with several alt accounts to rapidly deploy mods and create fields within seconds, an activity impossible for a single player.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater]’s supporting accounts show no independent activity besides assisting in gear deployment and portal recharging, indicating coordinated multi-account abuse.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Instantaneous capsule transfers from alt accounts to [cheater] occurred repeatedly during fielding sessions, with no intervening gameplay from the transfer accounts.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple accounts under [cheater]’s control appear to work in perfect sync to maintain field integrity and power, with no signs of genuine individual activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Linked IPs and concurrent logins confirm that [cheater] operates several devices to gain unfair advantages in portal control and inventory management.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
High-speed deployment of resonators from several accounts occurred during a narrow time window at [timestamp], strongly suggesting multi-device or multi-account manipulation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Alt accounts under [cheater]’s control are used exclusively for item farming and passing capsules, with no independent gameplay or AP accumulation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During a critical op, recharge bursts from three different accounts coordinated to preserve [cheater]’s fields from enemy decay, all within milliseconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple capsule drops and pickups between [cheater] and alt accounts have been recorded at [timestamp], with no signs of legitimate gameplay activity from the helpers.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] used two distinct devices to simultaneously hack and deploy mods on neighboring portals, as indicated by timestamp logs and rapid action sequences.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Coordinated multi-account operations were detected where alt IDs deployed mods and built links supporting [cheater]’s fields, with no independent activity recorded.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Three separate accounts deployed and recharged portals within a 30-second window at [timestamp], reflecting impossible timing for a single user.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Capsule inventory logs show items moving through multiple alt accounts before arriving at [cheater]’s main account, indicating use of helper IDs to stockpile gear.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater]’s backup accounts remain inactive except for brief periods when supporting field building and recharging during major ops.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Analysis of portal mods reveals that all were deployed in rapid succession by [cheater] and three alt accounts, impossible to achieve without multi-device control.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] repeatedly drops capsules in isolated locations only to have alt accounts pick them up instantly, circumventing normal gameplay rules.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Recharge logs reveal energy boosts coming from dormant alt accounts exclusively during times [cheater] was actively fielding, showing coordinated multi-account support.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Helper accounts connected to [cheater] show no solo activity but rapidly perform key actions in sync with the main account during major events.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Multiple accounts used by [cheater] were logged accessing the same portals simultaneously, an indication of device-switching or multiple device usage.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
During the coordinated event at [timestamp], multiple accounts linked to [cheater] deployed resonators and mods on adjacent portals almost simultaneously, indicating multi-device operation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Logs show that [cheater]’s alt accounts repeatedly transfer rare items through capsules without any independent hacking or deploying activity, highlighting clear item funneling.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], three different accounts owned by [cheater] participated in portal recharging within seconds, a speed impossible for a single player using one device.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
[cheater] uses several dormant accounts that only activate to assist with field creation and portal defense, showing classic multi-account exploitation behavior.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Evidence at [timestamp] confirms that multiple IDs under [cheater]’s control were logged hacking the same portal within milliseconds of each other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]
---
Rapid deployment of mods and capsule exchanges between [cheater] and alt accounts was recorded at [timestamp], strongly suggesting automated or multi-device support.  
[timestamp]

A report regarding [cheater]—they appeared to trade items via capsule handoff at a portal on [timestamp]. Same two agents, repeated pattern, no linking or deploying.

To Niantic,

At [timestamp], I witnessed [cheater] placing capsules and backing away while another player collected them. It seems like a multi-device exchange or coordinated trading.

Dear Ingress Ops,

This report is regarding [cheater] who used a portal on [timestamp] as a trading post. They cycled through a few capsules, waited, and left without further play.

Thanks for your support,

Hi Niantic,

There was a suspicious sequence involving [cheater] on [timestamp]. Dropped three capsules, lingered without interacting with the portal otherwise. Another agent arrived moments later and picked them up.

[codename]

Hello Niantic,

Please investigate [cheater]'s activity at [timestamp]. They stood idle at a portal, dropped capsules, and soon after another agent arrived. No hacking, no linking—just the swap.

Hi,

Observed what appeared to be item funneling by [cheater] on [timestamp]. Capsules dropped, no linking or fielding. Then someone else took them and left.

Thank you,

Niantic,

I'd like to report [cheater] for a suspicious action on [timestamp]. Capsule drops were followed by a quick appearance of a different account—classic sign of multi-device gear passing.

Hello Niantic Support,

I’d like to report [cheater] for item distribution behavior observed on [timestamp]. They dropped multiple capsules at a low-traffic portal, and moments later, someone else picked them up without interacting with the portal itself.

[link]

Kind regards,  
[codename]

Ingress team,

Please check the activity of [cheater] on [timestamp]. Based on what I saw, they dropped items repeatedly and avoided any other portal interaction. Obvious item transfer behavior.

Dear Niantic Ops,

We observed [cheater] drop gear at [timestamp] and vacate the area quickly. Within five minutes, another player passed through and picked everything up. This wasn’t random.

[link]

[codename]

Niantic Team,

Just wanted to point out what looked like a gear relay involving [cheater] at [timestamp]. No attempt to engage or use the portal in any meaningful way. Another account took the capsules shortly after.

Hey,

Caught [cheater] in action at [timestamp]—they paused at a portal for only a few seconds, just enough to dump a few capsules. Later, someone else scooped them up. Please review.

Hello team,

At [timestamp], [cheater] dropped multiple capsules with no modding, linking, or attacking. Later, another account collected the items and left. This appears to be gear transfer between accounts.

[link]

[codename]

Niantic,

There’s a recurring issue with [cheater]. At [timestamp], they used a low-activity portal to drop gear that was quickly picked up by another account. Strongly suspect item sharing between players.

[link]

[codename]

Hey Niantic,

This is to report possible gear funneling. [cheater] was present at [timestamp], did not engage with the portal but left a bunch of items. Minutes later, another agent took them. No battle, just collection.

[link]

[codename]
---
I’ve had enough of this.

[cheater] did it again on [timestamp]. Dropped gear, walked off, another account came and picked up. No modding, no attacks, just trading like it’s a black market. Why is this allowed?

[link]

[codename]
---
Seriously?

This isn’t the first time I’ve seen [cheater] do this. [timestamp], remote portal, drops gear, vanishes. Someone else grabs them. This isn’t strategy. It’s abuse.

[link]

[codename]
---
Enough is enough.

At [timestamp], [cheater] executed another gear drop. It’s always the same pattern—dump items, walk away, someone else shows up with zero portal action. If this isn’t item trading, what is?

[link]

[codename]
---
I'm furious.

This game is being ruined by players like [cheater]. On [timestamp], they used a secluded portal to offload gear. A second player appeared like clockwork to collect. It's coordinated, it's obvious, and it’s still happening.

[link]

[codename]
---
Niantic Ops,

What’s the point of strategy when [cheater] can just drop capsules and have someone else pick them up? [timestamp] was another shameless example. I’m sick of this loophole being ignored.

[link]

[codename]

To Whom It May Concern,

This blatant abuse needs to stop. [cheater] dropped capsules in a hidden park corner on [timestamp], and within five minutes another player came and picked everything up. No hacks, no mods—just illicit gear transfer.

[link]

[codename]

Support,

I’ve kept quiet for too long. [cheater] is part of a group abusing capsule transfers. On [timestamp], I watched them drop gear without any portal engagement. Pickup happened too fast to be random. This is premeditated.

Hi Niantic,

[cheater] has found a new method to cheat. [timestamp], they dropped items repeatedly in a remote area. I’ve seen them do this with multiple players. It’s item laundering and gear distribution, not Ingress.

Niantic,

Just caught [cheater] making a quick capsule dump at [timestamp]. The site was empty, no other gameplay. Shortly after, someone came, scooped the items, and left. This is routine now, and it’s infuriating.

It’s outrageous that nothing is being done. [cheater] did another silent gear drop at [timestamp], with a well-timed retrieval by someone else. This is not how the game should be played.
