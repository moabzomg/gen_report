Hello,
I’d like to report potential multi-accounting by Agent [cheater]. Several accounts are acting in lockstep with them, repeatedly assisting in portal captures, resonator deployment, and field creation.
The coordinated actions strongly suggest the same person is managing multiple accounts, which is against the rules.

Thank you,  
Agent [codename]

Dear Niantic,
[cheater] is possibly involved in selling accounts or farming gear to distribute unfairly. Their items are popping up in locations they never visit.

Hi,

I’m reporting a player using multiple accounts. On [timestamp], [cheater] and another level 5 account acted in perfect coordination within seconds, flipping, recharging, and deploying simultaneously.

[link]

The behavior is too synchronized to be legitimate. Likely a win-trading or multi-account setup.
---
On [timestamp], two agents were used in tandem to hold a farm — both sharing the same movement pattern. Device switching logs should confirm this.  
[link]
---
[cheater] was seen flipping their own portal using another agent's account at [timestamp], then linking back in a loop. Definitely multi-accounting.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] was seen dropping capsules on the ground and walking away while another agent of the opposing faction came to collect them minutes later. This is a clear case of illicit item trading.  
[link]
---
I filmed [cheater] dropping a capsule on the ground and sending a message over an external chat group. Moments later (around [timestamp]), a low-level enemy agent picked up the items and vanished.  
[link]
---
This is item laundering, essentially. [cheater] dropped gear at [timestamp], including multiple L8 resonators and XMPs, and within minutes they disappeared. We tracked the recipient.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] deployed one account’s resonators, then immediately upgraded them using a second account, alternating actions perfectly.  
[link]
---
[cheater] coordinated with a Level 1 account that only appears when they play. At [timestamp], both were used to capture and build.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] used account A to neutralize a portal and account B to immediately capture and fully deploy it. Both phones were seen in the same hand, and the player alternated between them flawlessly, confirming a multi-account strategy to control portal ownership solo.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] used a L2 dummy account to place soft mods on portals ahead of time, creating easy anchors for their main account. This kind of portal setup is never useful for strategic play unless someone is setting up their own playground.  
[link]
---
Both accounts shared the same movement path over multiple days, always appearing together at capture events, with one always benefiting the other.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
A known low-level account was used to hold large amounts of gear and pass them to [cheater] repeatedly across various cities.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
[cheater] used one account to repeatedly deploy portals and another to link and upgrade. Both actions occurred from the same bench within minutes.  
[link]  
---
A series of throwaway accounts were used to deploy common mods and protect field lanes. These accounts never returned after initial actions.  
[link]  
---
An L1 account was sacrificed to clear defensive mods on a portal, making way for [cheater] to recapture and mod it cleanly.  
[link]  
---
On [timestamp], both accounts deployed identical mods at the same portals and coordinated attacks, clearly controlled by the same person.  
[link]  
---
During key drop operations, the player used a dummy account to mule hundreds of keys across regions. No gear was used for other actions.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
One agent systematically destroys portals while another follows up within 15 seconds to deploy and link, always from the same IP and device type.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
The agent dropped capsules loaded with gear at [timestamp], which were instantly picked up by another nearby account. Witnesses confirmed solo activity.  
[link]  
---
Two known aliases used by the same person coordinated portal drops at precise times to simulate cross-faction play. Only one person was observed.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
All captured portals were immediately defended by a Level 3 recharger account located in the same physical location as [cheater].  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
Repeated mod flipping between two usernames every 5 minutes was done in the same park bench. Witnesses confirm only one person present.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
Two accounts consistently flip mods on the same portals in rotation, with physical evidence that the accounts are operated by one person.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
An agent operated two accounts simultaneously, one controlling links while the other placed resonators and mods on the same portal.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---
Agent used one account to field build and a second to keep fields alive by deploying resonators and mods.  
[timestamp]

Two cheaters sharing the same IP repeatedly flipped the same portal, indicating possible account sharing.  
[timestamp]

[cheater] created layered fields using synchronized links and mod deploys from two devices, as shown by simultaneous actions from separate accounts at [timestamp].  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

Portals across a 5km area were captured within three minutes by [cheater], supported by alt accounts deploying and linking in sync. GPS offset logs suggest multi-phone usage.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

Layered fields were built using resonators deployed by ghost accounts that only appear once in the portal history — all connected to [cheater]’s activity pattern.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

Multiple capsules tagged to [cheater] passed through 3 other accounts before being used in field construction. None of the transfer agents showed any deploy or hack activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

[cheater] fields using VR gear consistently sourced from the same alt account. Item ID logs show direct inventory handoffs through capsules with zero AP exchange.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

[cheater]’s supporting accounts show no independent activity besides assisting in gear deployment and portal recharging, indicating coordinated multi-account abuse.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

High-speed deployment of resonators from several accounts occurred during a narrow time window at [timestamp], strongly suggesting multi-device or multi-account manipulation.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

[cheater] used two distinct devices to simultaneously hack and deploy mods on neighboring portals, as indicated by timestamp logs and rapid action sequences.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

[cheater]’s backup accounts remain inactive except for brief periods when supporting field building and recharging during major ops.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

Helper accounts connected to [cheater] show no solo activity but rapidly perform key actions in sync with the main account during major events.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

At [timestamp], three different accounts owned by [cheater] participated in portal recharging within seconds, a speed impossible for a single player using one device.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

During the op at [timestamp], [cheater] leveraged multiple accounts to sustain portal shields and links against enemy attacks, as recharge logs indicate near-simultaneous activity.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

During the time frame around [timestamp], several accounts logged actions on the same portal in near perfect succession, an indicator of device switching or multi-device use.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

The deployment of high-value mods by multiple accounts linked to [cheater] occurred at [timestamp] within seconds, too fast for sequential play by a single user.  
[timestamp]  
[link]  
---

[cheater]’s capsule inventories are replenished by transfers from several alt accounts, as seen at [timestamp], enabling sustained field creation without normal farming.  
[timestamp]

Records from [timestamp] reveal capsule transfers between [cheater]’s accounts, facilitating the movement of high-level items without legitimate gameplay.

Hi there,

[cheater] dropped multiple capsules around [timestamp], but instead of regular play, they stayed idle while someone else collected everything moments later.

Hey Ingress Team,

Around [timestamp], [cheater] behaved unusually—spending a long time stationary, only dropping capsules. Another player came, picked them up. Likely gear handoff.

Hi there,

Spotted [cheater] at [timestamp] conducting what looked like a silent handoff. No combat, no mods—just dropped capsules and walked away. Minutes later, a known associate picked them up.

Hi,

During [timestamp], [cheater] placed down a line of capsules at an unmonitored spot. No links, no hacks, no deploys. Soon after, a different agent took them. Please investigate.

Hello,

This report is about [cheater] spotted at [timestamp] at a portal rarely used. Their actions were limited to dropping capsules. Another agent came shortly after, clearly not a coincidence.

[link]

Thank you,  
[codename]

To whom it may concern,

On [timestamp], [cheater] was spotted depositing gear at a non-strategic portal. Soon afterward, a different agent arrived, interacting only long enough to collect the items. I believe this is deliberate trading.

[link]

Regards,  
[codename]

Hi there,

[cheater] has been repeating a drop-and-go pattern. On [timestamp], they left a bunch of capsules and immediately walked away. Another agent retrieved them shortly after. This looks like item trading.

[link]

[codename]
---
Niantic,

This is unacceptable. At [timestamp], [cheater] deliberately dropped capsules at a dead portal and within minutes, someone else showed up to collect. This is organized item trading, not gameplay.

[link]

[codename]
---
Niantic Support,

I’m extremely frustrated. [cheater] clearly used a second account or buddy system to offload items at [timestamp]. You can see there’s no interaction other than a capsule dump. Seconds later, the pickup. Do something.

[link]

[codename]

Hey,

[cheater] keeps exploiting the system. [timestamp] was the latest incident. Item dump followed by someone else taking it without any real gameplay. Why is this behavior going unpunished?

[link]

[codename]
---
Niantic,

Why are item traders still playing freely? [cheater] has been doing this over and over. On [timestamp], they dumped several capsules and disappeared. A second player picked them up with surgical timing. This is coordinated cheating.

[link]

[codename]

Hello,

This game means a lot to me, but people like [cheater] make me want to quit. On [timestamp], they again orchestrated a gear transfer. There was no other portal interaction. This is not acceptable.

[link]

[codename]

Niantic Team,

On [timestamp], [cheater] performed another suspicious drop of capsules at a remote portal. No linking or hacking took place. Another agent arrived shortly after to collect all items. This pattern of gear trading is hurting fair players.

[link]

[codename]
---
Dear Niantic,

Please investigate [cheater]'s behavior at [timestamp]. They dropped numerous capsules at a portal, then left without interacting with it. The gear was soon after collected by another agent. This is clearly item laundering.

Hello,

[cheater] once again abused the game on [timestamp] by dumping multiple items at a quiet portal and leaving immediately. Another player came by and picked them all up, bypassing any portal interaction.

At [timestamp], [cheater] was observed capturing multiple portals in a restricted area with no physical access. This behavior strongly suggests the use of multiple accounts or devices.
[timestamp]
[link]

Regards,
[codename]
---
Please investigate [cheater] for suspicious activity noted on [timestamp]. The player linked portals across vast distances in a short time, indicating potential multi-account usage.

Sincerely,
[codename]

The community has noticed [cheater] consistently capturing portals in areas they cannot physically access. This occurred again on [timestamp].

Once again, [cheater] has been seen deploying resonators in remote locations at [timestamp]. This pattern has been reported before with no action taken.
[timestamp]
[link]

Frustrated,
[codename]
---
Multiple agents have witnessed [cheater] switching between accounts during gameplay. This undermines the integrity of Ingress.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Observed [cheater] deploying resonators with two devices in hand. This is a clear violation of fair play.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Frustrated to report [cheater] again. Despite previous reports, the multi-account behavior continues. Simultaneous portal captures from different devices.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
It’s become increasingly obvious that [cheater] is operating multiple accounts. The pattern of portal captures and immediate linking from nearby accounts is too consistent to ignore.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
The local community has raised concerns about [cheater] using shared accounts. The timing and coordination of actions are beyond coincidence.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Please review the activity logs for [cheater]. The timing and coordination of actions suggest multi-account usage.
[timestamp]
[link]
[codename]
---
This is the third time this week [cheater] has used multiple accounts to take down and rebuild portals. It’s coordinated and unfair.
[timestamp]
[link]
[codename]
---
It's becoming a pattern—[cheater] is always present at multiple portals simultaneously. This is not possible without account sharing or multi-device use.
[timestamp]
[link]
Sincerely,
[codename]
---
The community is losing faith in fair play. [cheater] is using multiple accounts to dominate key areas. Please take action.
[timestamp]
[link]
[codename]
---
We've observed [cheater] repeatedly linking portals in rapid succession from different locations. This pattern strongly suggests the use of multiple accounts or devices.
