During the past 24 hours, Agent [cheater] has rapidly moved between portals located in different regions, without any delay that would allow for physical travel.

The pattern indicates GPS spoofing or an emulator-based attack. This kind of behavior severely affects fair play and coordinated efforts by legitimate agents.

Hello Niantic Enforcement Team,

After careful analysis of gameplay data, we observed multiple irregularities in the location data reported by [cheater]. The account's GPS coordinates show sudden jumps over large distances in implausibly short time intervals, inconsistent with legitimate movement. This pattern strongly indicates the use of GPS spoofing tools or location falsification software.

Additionally, the reported speed and travel routes violate known physical limitations and geography, further confirming the suspicious activity.

We recommend a thorough investigation and appropriate action against [cheater] to preserve fair gameplay integrity.

Dear Niantic Support,

This report concerns suspicious activity detected on the account associated with [cheater]. The geolocation logs demonstrate unnatural movements, including instant transitions between distant locations and inconsistent positioning during gameplay sessions.

Hi Niantic,

Dear Niantic Enforcement Team,

Following a detailed review of [cheater]’s gameplay logs, we found multiple instances of sudden, unrealistic location changes inconsistent with physical movement capabilities. These abrupt jumps in coordinates suggest the use of GPS spoofing or related tools to falsify location.

As an agent in the field, I noticed [cheater] capturing portals far apart in impossible time spans.

Hello Niantic team,

The time between actions is not consistent with real-world travel. Agent [cheater] must be spoofing.
Please take the appropriate steps.

Dear Ingress support,
I suspect [cheater] is using a location hack. Their movements across cities in minutes are impossible.

Hi,
As a concerned player, I believe [cheater] is teleporting across long distances unrealistically.

Greetings Niantic,
Please investigate agent [cheater]. Their portal interactions are impossible given the time gaps.

Hi Niantic, I've noticed that [cheater] is accessing remote portals within seconds, far beyond realistic travel time. This strongly suggests spoofing. Please investigate.

It’s highly suspicious that [cheater] is attacking portals across cities with no visible activity or travel records. Even locals have confirmed the person wasn’t there physically.  
Thanks for looking into it.

Dear Ingress team,  
The agent [cheater] keeps flipping and capturing portals in distant towns instantly after local players defend them. Their presence makes no sense geographically.  
Please verify travel legitimacy.

Something strange is going on with [cheater]. They keep showing up in multiple countries within hours—clearly not by legal travel means.  
Can this be investigated for GPS manipulation?

Hello,  
We suspect [cheater] is spoofing. They have been attacking portals in remote mountain areas impossible to access at night or during park closures.
