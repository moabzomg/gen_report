Hello Niantic Enforcement Team,

After careful analysis of gameplay data, we observed multiple irregularities in the location data reported by [cheater]. The account's GPS coordinates show sudden jumps over large distances in implausibly short time intervals, inconsistent with legitimate movement. This pattern strongly indicates the use of GPS spoofing tools or location falsification software.

Additionally, the reported speed and travel routes violate known physical limitations and geography, further confirming the suspicious activity.

We recommend a thorough investigation and appropriate action against [cheater] to preserve fair gameplay integrity.

Immediate action is recommended to preserve game fairness and integrity.

Kind regards,  
[codename]
---
Niantic, urgent attention needed.

At [timestamp], [cheater] performed a series of actions that completely disrupted regional play. They appeared out of nowhere, rapidly took down portals, and linked them in patterns that are humanly impossible given the terrain and travel time. This strongly suggests the use of location spoofing.

We're not just talking about unfair play — this is sabotage. Legitimate agents who’ve been working hard for weeks had their efforts wiped out in minutes by someone likely sitting comfortably at home, spoofing locations.

[link]

Please act now. Players are losing faith.

[codename]

Hey Niantic,

Just dropping a quick note because something fishy happened at [timestamp]. [cheater] somehow managed to take down several portals and link across ridiculous distances like it was nothing. I mean, there’s no way a real person could do all that in such a short time.

It really feels like they’re using some kind of spoofing app — we’ve seen this kind of thing before, and it’s super frustrating for the rest of us trying to play fair.

[link]

Can you check it out? We’d really appreciate some backup on this one.

Thanks,

Agent [cheater] has been involved in portal captures that span across regions in an implausible timeframe, indicating potential spoofing.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
The portal activity of Agent [cheater] suggests the use of unauthorized tools, as they have captured and linked portals that are geographically far apart in rapid succession.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
The behavior of Agent [cheater] includes linking portals that are far apart without any delay, which points to GPS spoofing.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] appears to be circumventing normal gameplay mechanics by performing actions that would require teleportation, such as deploying resonators in distant locations almost simultaneously.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
I noticed Agent [cheater] interacting with portals in multiple cities within minutes, which is not feasible without location manipulation.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] has shown a repeated ability to deploy resonators and link portals in distant areas without any travel time, which is highly suspicious.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
There is a consistent pattern in Agent [cheater]'s movements that indicates spoofing, especially when they link portals that are hundreds of kilometers apart within seconds.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
The portal linking pattern of Agent [cheater] is indicative of GPS spoofing, as they have created links between portals that are not physically reachable in the time observed.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] has been repeatedly seen capturing portals in different regions without any reasonable delay, suggesting the use of GPS spoofing techniques.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
The gameplay of Agent [cheater] includes actions that are only possible through GPS manipulation, such as linking portals across cities in seconds.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
The actions of Agent [cheater] are highly suspicious, as they have managed to interact with portals in multiple provinces in a single hour.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
I am concerned about Agent [cheater]'s portal activity, which includes rapid movements between locations that are not physically reachable in the observed timeframe.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] has been seen deploying resonators in multiple cities within a short period, suggesting the use of spoofing tools.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] has been reported for interacting with portals in geographically distant areas in a short span of time, which is not feasible through normal gameplay.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] has been interacting with portals in a manner that suggests they are not physically present at the locations, which undermines fair play.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] has been observed deploying resonators and linking portals across vast distances in timeframes that defy physical travel, raising serious concerns about GPS spoofing.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
Agent [cheater] linked portals from opposite ends of the country in a timeframe that is impossible without location spoofing.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
I observed Agent [cheater] capturing portals in different regions within minutes, which is not possible without spoofing their location.
[timestamp]
[link]
---
