The location data recorded at [timestamp] highlights irregular movement by [cheater]. The player’s device alternated between physically impossible points almost instantly, confirming the use of location faking tools or spoofing software.

[link]

This type of violation compromises fair play and contravenes Niantic’s terms.

Sincerely,  
[codename]
---
Observed at [timestamp], [cheater]'s position data revealed multiple simultaneous presences in different regions. The movement speed and timing are incompatible with legitimate travel methods.

[link]

Such evidence strongly supports the conclusion that [cheater] is manipulating GPS signals to gain an unfair advantage.

Regards,  
[codename]
---
Reviewing logs from [timestamp], [cheater] consistently appears in portals located in geographically distant locations with no feasible transit time. The telemetry data matches common signatures of GPS spoofing applications.

[link]

This behavior enables cheating by circumventing normal travel constraints imposed by the game.

Kind regards,  
[codename]
---
At [timestamp], rapid teleportation events were captured involving [cheater], where portal hacks happened across various locations in unrealistic time frames. This is indicative of the use of third-party location faking tools.

[link]

Such activity undermines community trust and should be addressed promptly.

Best,  
[codename]
---
After careful examination of the activity recorded at [timestamp], it is clear that [cheater] has been employing sophisticated GPS spoofing techniques. The movement logs show impossible travel speeds between portals that are hundreds of kilometers apart within seconds, which cannot be explained by legitimate play.

[link]

This manipulation severely disrupts the balance of the game and provides [cheater] with an unfair edge over other players.

I trust Niantic will take appropriate action against this violation.

Best regards,  
[codename]
---
Reviewing the data from [timestamp], there are numerous indications that [cheater] falsified their physical location to gain unauthorized access to portals far beyond their real-world reach. These repeated rapid location jumps are a telltale sign of GPS spoofing apps.

[link]

Dear Niantic Support Team,

I am writing to report suspicious activity observed at [timestamp], which raises significant concerns about fair gameplay in Ingress. The individual known as [cheater] appears to be engaging in actions that strongly suggest the use of GPS spoofing tools, allowing them to interact with portals across vast distances in an unrealistically short amount of time. Specifically, during the above timestamp, [cheater] was observed capturing and linking portals hundreds of kilometers apart within mere minutes.

Such behavior undermines the integrity of the game and creates an imbalanced experience for those of us who play honestly. It’s particularly discouraging for local agents who strive to maintain and protect their fields and communities. Spoofing not only grants unfair control over key areas but also discourages legitimate players from continued participation.

The following link provides documentation and timestamped evidence for your reference:  
[link]

I trust your team will look into this case thoroughly and take appropriate action in line with your policies on fair play.

Thank you for your continued commitment to fostering a just and competitive environment.

Respectfully,  
[codename]

Niantic, urgent attention needed.

At [timestamp], [cheater] performed a series of actions that completely disrupted regional play. They appeared out of nowhere, rapidly took down portals, and linked them in patterns that are humanly impossible given the terrain and travel time. This strongly suggests the use of location spoofing.

We're not just talking about unfair play — this is sabotage. Legitimate agents who’ve been working hard for weeks had their efforts wiped out in minutes by someone likely sitting comfortably at home, spoofing locations.

[link]

Please act now. Players are losing faith.

[codename]

To Niantic Enforcement Team,

Upon technical review of gameplay logs recorded on [timestamp], it appears that [cheater] manipulated location data via GPS spoofing tools, likely facilitated by third-party software such as Fake GPS or similar root-based apps. Portal interactions occurred in geographically disparate regions — some over 300 km apart — within an impossibly short time window (less than 10 minutes between captures).

Furthermore, the link structures executed by [cheater] do not align with any viable physical traversal path, and their timing is perfectly aligned with standard auto-routing scripts commonly found in bot-assisted play.

[link]

I urge the team to verify device signatures, IP history, and action timestamps to confirm this misuse.

Regards,  
[codename]
---
Hey Niantic,

Just dropping a quick note because something fishy happened at [timestamp]. [cheater] somehow managed to take down several portals and link across ridiculous distances like it was nothing. I mean, there’s no way a real person could do all that in such a short time.

It really feels like they’re using some kind of spoofing app — we’ve seen this kind of thing before, and it’s super frustrating for the rest of us trying to play fair.

[link]

Can you check it out? We’d really appreciate some backup on this one.

Thanks,  
[codename]

Dear Niantic,

At [timestamp], I witnessed gameplay that left me truly disheartened. [cheater] took over an entire network of portals I’d been maintaining for weeks — not by effort or coordination, but clearly by cheating. They jumped between distant locations in ways no real player ever could, undoing hours of fielding and planning in mere minutes.

As someone who’s invested in the community and put in countless hours walking, biking, planning routes — it’s crushing to see that all invalidated by someone with a spoofing tool and no regard for fairness.

I know you care about this game and the people who play it. So I’m asking, not just as a player, but as someone who genuinely loves this game: please look into it.

[link]

Thank you,  
[codename]

At [timestamp], [cheater] captured multiple portals across distant regions, over 300 km apart, within minutes. This behavior is physically impossible and points strongly to GPS spoofing.

[link]

Hello Niantic,

I'm deeply disappointed. On [timestamp], [cheater] showed up in our area and wiped out our field structure in what can only be described as spoof-assisted gameplay. They appeared, acted, and disappeared within an unrealistically short span.

[link]

Please investigate this. It’s ruining the game for those of us who play honestly.

Niantic Support,

During [timestamp], we observed [cheater] jump between portals that require extensive travel with no delay. They linked cross-region portals instantly — this has to be location spoofing.

[link]

Multiple agents witnessed this and are ready to provide statements if needed.
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] completed actions that would require 400+ km of travel in less than 6 hours. The travel history, portal hacks, and link creation timeline are impossible for a human agent.

[link]

I strongly suspect third-party automation or spoofing tools.
---
Niantic team,

There’s highly suspicious behavior from [cheater] observed at [timestamp]. Over the course of a single day, they travelled more than 400 km, performed hundreds of actions, and had zero rest intervals. This suggests third-party automation tools are in use.

[link]
---
Hey,

Just a heads-up — [cheater] is back at it. On [timestamp], they showed up in a restricted-access zone, dropped a field, then vanished. Locals confirmed no one was physically present.

[link]

Spoofing alert again.
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] captured portals over 250 km apart within a span of 12 minutes. No agent can realistically travel such a distance that quickly. Spoofing is the only explanation.  
[link]
---
Hello, this happened at [timestamp]: [cheater] suddenly appeared at a portal in a locked, restricted facility, then disappeared after a few actions. No physical access was possible.  
[link]
---
During [timestamp], [cheater] linked portals from opposite corners of the region without any known travel path in between. Other players confirmed no one was seen on-site.  
[link]
---
We watched [cheater] capture, link, and deploy across five towns in under 2 hours at [timestamp]. This level of travel defies physical limits. Clearly GPS manipulation is involved.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], a remote portal in the mountains was captured by [cheater], who has no history of visiting the area. Spoofed? Almost certainly.  
[link]
---
Niantic, please investigate this urgently. [cheater] covered over 400 km between actions at [timestamp]. That's impossible without spoofing.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] built layered fields over water bodies with no walkways or bridges nearby. No signs of boat usage. This screams spoofing.  
[link]
---
We observed unusual links by [cheater] at [timestamp], connecting portals in ways that violate line-of-sight travel. It’s extremely suspicious.  
[link]
---
[cheater] accessed a military installation portal at [timestamp]. No one is allowed inside except staff. They have spoofed this location.  
[link]

[link]
---
Between [timestamp], [cheater] deployed portals across three separate islands without crossing waterways or being detected in transit. The timeline confirms spoofing.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] destroyed portals and linked across rural areas that require long hikes or vehicle access. Weather and terrain would have made this impossible in that window.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] linked two portals located in restricted airport zones with no ingress or egress records. Neither has public access.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] captured portals inside an active construction zone with locked gates and CCTV. No agent was recorded entering.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] linked and deployed at multiple hilltop sites without time for travel. No vehicle or footpath usage was observed.  
[link]
---
Spoofing was highly likely at [timestamp], when [cheater] jumped 300 km, linked, and disappeared again. Movement patterns were unnatural.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] appeared on a portal located at the summit of a mountain which requires a 4-hour hike to reach. No ascent time was recorded, and no photos or known hikers encountered this person. The player deployed, linked, and disappeared within 3 minutes—physically impossible without GPS manipulation.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], [cheater] captured portals inside a military base. The base has 24/7 surveillance and strict ID checks, and civilians are not allowed past the outer fence. No permission or badge entry was logged, and the agent vanished after attacking five portals.  
[link]
---
[cheater] linked two portals 600 km apart at [timestamp], less than 12 minutes after visiting a dense urban portal farm. The movement history shows no intermediary steps—only teleportation between high-value sites. No flights or driving logs match this route.  
[link]
---
At [timestamp], a coordinated BAF anchor deployment occurred in the middle of a reservoir island without ferry service or kayak access. [cheater] claimed to have "flown over" but weather logs show 40 km/h winds, and no other players saw any activity.  
[link]
---
On [timestamp], a portal farm was recharged across 12 portals in under 6 seconds, with nearly 200 XM bursts logged with exact 0.5-second intervals. This level of precision and timing points to a macro tool or automation script.
