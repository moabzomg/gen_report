During the past 24 hours, Agent [cheater] has rapidly moved between portals located in different regions, without any delay that would allow for physical travel.

The pattern indicates GPS spoofing or an emulator-based attack. This kind of behavior severely affects fair play and coordinated efforts by legitimate agents.

Dear support,

There is a repeated pattern of [cheater] deploying resonators at hard-to-reach portals instantly after capturing others far away. This seems like clear spoofing.

Hi Niantic,

We have flagged the player [cheater] for suspected location spoofing. The evidence includes multiple occurrences where the player’s reported location suddenly jumps hundreds of kilometers within seconds, a physical impossibility without cheating.

This suspicious behavior compromises the game environment and may give [cheater] unfair advantages in game events.

Please conduct a thorough investigation and update us on the findings.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
[codename]

Dear Niantic Enforcement Team,

After reviewing location data from [cheater], we observed multiple instances where the account's reported GPS coordinates abruptly shifted across large distances in impossibly short timeframes. These anomalies strongly suggest the use of spoofing applications or GPS manipulation tools.

Such behavior severely undermines the fairness and integrity of gameplay.
[timestamp]

Hello Niantic Team,

Hi there,

Please see the activity of [cheater] on [timestamp] involving impossible travel distances. The agent managed to capture a portal in [city], then within moments appeared in [remote area].

This pattern is consistent with GPS spoofing. I urge a review of [cheater]’s movements and actions.

Best regards,  
[codename]

Hello Niantic Team,

I’ve been tracking [cheater]'s activity and the GPS data looks impossible. For example, at [timestamp], they captured a portal in Tokyo, and then at [timestamp1], they took down another portal in New York City.

[timestamp]
[link]

This kind of teleporting is not feasible without spoofing. Kindly investigate.

Greetings,

[cheater]’s recent portal activity defies natural movement. At [timestamp], there’s a capture in San Francisco; at [timestamp1], a portal in Los Angeles is destroyed.

Dear Ingress team,  
The agent [cheater] keeps flipping and capturing portals in distant towns instantly after local players defend them. Their presence makes no sense geographically.  
Please verify travel legitimacy.  
[timestamp]
[link]

[codename]
---
The data recorded at [timestamp] indicates a clear pattern of GPS spoofing by [cheater], resulting in unnatural location jumps inconsistent with normal player movement.

[link]
---
Reports indicate that on [timestamp], [cheater] exhibited GPS coordinates that jump unrealistically between portals dozens of kilometers apart, with no reasonable travel time. This strongly suggests the use of GPS spoofing apps to fake location and gain an unfair edge.

[link]

Best regards,  
[codename]

Analysis of portal interaction timestamps at [timestamp] confirms that [cheater] did not physically visit the locations, as travel times do not align with reported coordinates, confirming GPS spoofing.

Recorded GPS traces from [timestamp] for [cheater] show anomalies inconsistent with physical presence, reinforcing suspicions of GPS spoofing or manipulation.

Such evidence strongly supports the conclusion that [cheater] is manipulating GPS signals to gain an unfair advantage.

Regards,  
[codename]
---
The logs dated [timestamp] illustrate that [cheater] consistently “teleports” between distant geographic locations without any realistic travel time. This pattern suggests active use of location spoofing software, giving an illicit advantage in portal control.

[link]

This action breaches Niantic's terms and compromises fair competition.

Please prioritize this case for review.

Regards,  
[codename]

Niantic, urgent attention needed.

At [timestamp], [cheater] performed a series of actions that completely disrupted regional play. They appeared out of nowhere, rapidly took down portals, and linked them in patterns that are humanly impossible given the terrain and travel time. This strongly suggests the use of location spoofing.

We're not just talking about unfair play — this is sabotage. Legitimate agents who’ve been working hard for weeks had their efforts wiped out in minutes by someone likely sitting comfortably at home, spoofing locations.

[link]

Please act now. Players are losing faith.

[codename]
---
At [timestamp], [cheater] captured multiple portals across distant regions, over 300 km apart, within minutes. This behavior is physically impossible and points strongly to GPS spoofing.

[link]

Hey,

Just a heads-up — [cheater] is back at it. On [timestamp], they showed up in a restricted-access zone, dropped a field, then vanished. Locals confirmed no one was physically present.
