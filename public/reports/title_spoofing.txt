Suspiciously fast links  
Teleport ops are the new meta?  
Teleport trap again  
Teleportation between cities reported
Teleportation masquerading as gameplay
Teleportation Pattern by [cheater]
Teleportation-like behavior in logs  
That field geometry proves cheating
That field? Fully fabricated
That link is not physically possible
That link is physically impossible
That travel log is a work of fiction
The “phantom deployer” strikes again
The agent who never rests  
The commute speed is unreal
The evidence is routine now
The game is not meant to be magic
The logs don’t lie, [cheater] does  
The quietest cheater in town
The roads don’t go there
There’s no road, but [cheater] was there?
They must own a cloaking device  
They were never at any portal
This “op” was entirely fabricated
This agent skipped geography class
This can't be explained by drift
This cannot happen by accident  
This field shouldn’t be possible
This game isn’t sci-fi  
This is getting ridiculous now
This is not how Ingress works
This is not real play  
This isn’t a fair game  
This isn't bad GPS — it’s cheating
This isn't subtle anymore
This isn’t teleportation—it’s spoofing  
This kind of travel is sci-fi
This movement is not human  
This one breaks physics  
This one broke space-time  
This pattern matches prior spoofing  
This play is beyond logic  
This route only exists in dreams
This travel pattern is a joke
This was not legit  
This was not physically possible
Three continents in one op. Seriously?
Three zones cleared by [cheater] in an hour – cheating
Time log mismatch proves cheating
Time travel agent detected  
Time-distance mismatch in [cheater] logs
Time-space reality violated again
Timing doesn’t match location
Timing too perfect to be legit  
Tired of seeing fake actions every day
Tired of this teleport act  
Too clean to be human movement
Too clean, too fast, too fake
Too efficient to be legitimate movement
Too fast for any known vehicle  
Too fast to be real  
Too fast, too far, too fake  
Too many fields, no visible effort  
Too many inaccessible portal actions to ignore
Too quick for terrain  
Too-fast movement between check-ins – possible spoofing
Travel distances defy physics – [cheater] likely spoofing

Warp-speed fielding by [cheater]
Warped into portal cluster instantly
Warping between towns isn’t legit
Was watching the portal – [cheater] never came
Wasn't there, yet captured it
Wasn’t there. Never is.  
We all know that was a spoof
Where is [cheater] really?  
Why even pretend anymore?

Zero XM build-up, just action  
Zero XM trail, yet full op complete
